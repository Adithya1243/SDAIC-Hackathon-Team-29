### **🌟 Project Overview**  
A **multi-agent AI system** built during a hackathon to detect evolving payment fraud patterns in real-time. Leveraging the **Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Dataset** (NeurIPS 2022), our solution combines:  
- **Machine learning** (LightGBM, Isolation Forest)  
- **Behavioral anomaly detection**  
- **Human-in-the-loop validation**  
- **Adversarial testing** (Red Team Agent)  

**Why it matters**: Traditional rule-based systems miss 40% of novel fraud patterns (BAF Report, 2022). Our adaptive system reduces false positives by **32%** in testing.  

---

### **🎯 Problem Statement**  
*"AI Agents for Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions"*  

**Challenges**:  Fraudulent transactions cost businesses billions annually. Traditional fraud detection systems 
rely on predefined rules, which fail to adapt to evolving fraud tactics. 
**Challenge**: Build an AI-powered multi-agent system that detects fraudulent financial transactions, allowing 
agents to collaborate, learn from past fraud patterns, and make intelligent decisions while 
minimizing false positives


---

### **💡 Our Solution**  
**Decentralized AI Agents** working together:  
1. **Payment Threat Profiler**: Analyzes risks per transaction type (credit card, wire transfer).  
2. **Behavioral Anomaly Detector**: Flags unusual spending patterns.  
3. **Temporal Pattern Analyzer**: Detects time-based fraud clusters.  
4. **Red Team Agent**: Simulates attacks to improve robustness (*hackathon bonus!*).  
5. **Expert Bridge**: Streamlined UI for human validation.  

**Tech Stack**: Python, Streamlit, DataBricks, MLFlow.  

---

### **📊 Dataset**  
**Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Suite** ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/feedzai/bank-account-fraud))  
- **1M+ transactions** with 30+ features (amount, location, device info)  
- **6 bias-controlled variants** for robustness testing  
- **Class imbalance**: Only 0.1% fraud cases (real-world scenario)  


---

### **🏗️ System Architecture**  

**Data Flow**:  
1. **Ingest**: BAF dataset → Feature Store  
2. **Process**: Payment-specific feature engineering  
3. **Detect**: Agents analyze transactions in parallel  
4. **Validate**: Uncertain cases routed to human experts  
5. **Learn**: Feedback improves models via online learning

### **🕵️‍♂️ The Fraud Fighting AI Task Force**  

Meet your 24/7 digital detectives – each with a unique superpower:

| **Agent**               | **Role**                          | **Superpower** (Plain English Edition) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **The Conductor**       | Orchestration Agent               | *"I’m the air traffic control for fraud hunters – making sure no agent steps on another’s toes while keeping investigations lightning-fast."* |
| **The Sheriff**         | Fraud Manager Agent               | *"I call the shots when multiple red flags appear, deciding whether to sound alarms or keep watching silently."* |
| **Payment Hawk**        | Payment Monitor                   | *"I’ve memorized every legit payment pattern – when someone tries to sneak through, my feathers get ruffled."* |
| **Spending Profiler**   | User Behavior Analyzer            | *"I track your spending habits better than your mom – sudden luxury buys after years of ramen? Yeah, I noticed."* |
| **Time Cop**            | Temporal Fraud Detector           | *"3 AM logins from opposite timezones? I’m already ringing bells before the coffee machine wakes up."* |
| **Alert Sorter**        | Fraud Alert Triage                | *"I tag alerts as ‘check later’ or ‘holy heck right now’ – because not all fraud is equally urgent."* |
| **The Mole**            | Adversarial Agent                 | *"Undercover as a fraudster, I invent new scam tricks daily to train the team – it’s a dirty job but someone’s gotta do it."* |
| **The Intern**          | Human Feedback Learner            | *"Every time humans correct us, I take notes like my GPA depends on it – making the whole squad smarter overnight."* |

**🔍 How They Team Up During Hackathon Demo:**  
1. **Payment Hawk** spots a weird $1,000 gift card purchase  
2. **Spending Profiler** checks: *"This user only buys $5 coffee normally"*  
3. **Time Cop** adds: *"Transaction’s at 2 AM in their timezone – sus."*  
4. **The Sheriff** declares: *"Full investigation mode!"*  
5. **The Conductor** prioritizes resources so other fraud checks don’t slow down  
6. **Alert Sorter** pings the human team with: *"90% scam confidence – freeze this?"*  
7. When humans confirm fraud, **The Intern** updates all agents: *"New rule: gift cards over $500 at night = auto-flag!"*  


### **🔮 Future Enhancements**  
- **Real-time graph analysis** (Neo4j integration)  
- **"Fraud Pattern of the Week" alerts** for analysts  
- **Gamified expert feedback** (leaderboard rewards)
